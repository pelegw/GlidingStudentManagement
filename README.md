# Gliding Club Student Management System

A comprehensive web-based management system for gliding clubs to track student training records, ground briefings, and licensing information. Built with Django and designed to support both English and Hebrew languages with full RTL support.

This project was mostly "vibe-coded" with the majority of code (all HTML code, and even this readme, limited backend code) generated by Claude Sonnet 3.7 

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Student Training Records Management** - Track flight sessions, exercises, and progress
- **Ground Briefing System** - Manage theoretical training sessions records 
- **Exercise Performance Tracking** - Detailed tracking of pre-solo and post-solo exercises as required by local regulation
- **Digital Sign-off Process** - Instructors can sign off student flights

### Reports & Exports
- **PDF Export** - Full training reports with Hebrew/English support
- **CSV Export** - Data export for external analysis
- **Exercise Matrix** - Visual progress tracking grid for submission to local CAA

### Internationalization
- **Bilingual Support** - Full English and Hebrew language support
- **RTL Layout** - Proper right-to-left text direction for Hebrew
- **Localization** - Date formats and UI elements adapted for both languages

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django 4.2+ with Python 3.11+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 17+
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 with RTL support
- **PDF Generation**: WeasyPrint with Hebrew font support
- **Authentication**: Django's built-in auth with django-axes for security

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+ (for local development)
- PostgreSQL 17 (if running locally)

## Quick Start with Docker

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pelegw/studentlog.git
   cd studentlog
   ```

2. **Create environment file**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Initialize the database**
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
   docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
   docker-compose exec web python manage.py import_initial_data
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   - Main application: http://localhost:80
   - Admin interface: http://localhost:80/admin

## Development Setup

1. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd gliding_club
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure database**
   ```bash
   # Update settings.py for local development
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

4. **Load initial data**
   ```bash
   python manage.py import_initial_data
   python manage.py import_ground_briefings data/ground_briefings.xlsx
   ```

5. **Run development server**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Data Management

### Import Initial Data
The system includes Excel files with training topics, exercises, and ground briefing topics:

```bash
# Import all initial data
python manage.py import_initial_data

# Import ground briefing data
python manage.py import_ground_briefings data/ground_briefings.xlsx
```

### Backup and Restore
```bash
# Create backup
docker-compose exec backup pg_dump -h db -U postgres gliding_club > backup.sql

# Restore backup
docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -d gliding_club < backup.sql
```

## Customization

### Club Branding
Update the club name and branding in `settings.py`:
```python
CLUB_NAME = "Your Gliding Club Name"
```

### Language Support
The system supports both English and Hebrew. Users can switch languages using the dropdown in the navigation bar.

### Adding New Exercises
1. Use the Django admin interface
2. Import from Excel files using the management command
3. Add programmatically through the Exercise model


## Production Deployment
